/* 

TYPESCRIPT -> 

. Gives us additional features on top of JS;
. Compiles to regular JavaScript;
. Made and maintained by Microsoft;

WHY SHOULD WE USE IT? -> 

. More readable and maintainable code;
. More robust code;
. Catch errors in editor rather than in production;
. Very popular among tech companies;

HOW TO SET IT UP -> Write "npm install -g typescript" in the terminal, and than create a new folder. To create a TypeScript file write ts at the end

. When you write "tsc index"(tsc typescript-file-name) in the terminal, a file called index.js will appear, that is the TS compiler, that is compiling the TS code into JS. After doing...
that, you will see that the index.js file is using an old type of code, so write in the terminal "tsc --init" to create a new tsconfig.json file, that is used to configer the behavior...
of the compiler. After that just write "tsc" in the terminal, it should change the weird old code to a new one. But to the tsc code to work(the compiler to work), we don't want to...
write that all the time we do a change, so write "tsc --watch"
